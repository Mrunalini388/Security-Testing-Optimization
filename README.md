# üîê AI-Based Log Anomaly Detector

# Introduction

This tool helps security analysts and penetration testers by automatically detecting anomalies in web server scan logs generated by popular tools like **Nmap** and **Nikto**. Using machine learning (Isolation Forest), it identifies unusual log entries that might indicate potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or suspicious activity. This aids faster and more accurate prioritization during security assessments.

# Features

- Processes raw scan logs from Nmap and Nikto
- Extracts simple features such as line length and presence of security-related keywords
- Applies Isolation Forest, an unsupervised AI algorithm, to detect anomalous log lines
- Labels log entries as **Normal** or **Anomaly** to help identify suspicious events
- Saves detailed results to a report file for review and further analysis
